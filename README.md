# Inspect
Inspect teaches people how to detect disinformation. In the first three “tutorial” levels, users determine whether a given AI-generated statement is true or false. Then, in the “freeplay” mode, users determine which of two completely AI-generated sentences is false or more extreme. Each option has a corresponding short-form video generated by Sora 2. After the user selects an option, they gain instant feedback on their correctness. 

These “challenges” are in a Firestore database on Google’s Firebase and the application logic is programmed primarily in React JS. Furthermore, we also store each user’s completed problems on Firestore to prevent duplicates. For data security, we minimize the information we store about a user—only their email, display name, and completed problems are stored. The app is deployed using Firebase hosting here. Stylization and microinteractions were done using CSS. The corresponding Sora 2 videos are stored using Firebase Storage.

In addition, to make the app fun, it includes a variety of microinteractions such as a moving and blinking eye, according to the theme of the app’s title Inspect, sound effects for correct and incorrect answers, and a greenish highlight.

Furthermore, for safety, users are prevented from copying the disinformation text and Sora 2 videos include watermarks. We included some more controversial topics since the real internet contains much disinformation on them, but we prioritized more harmless topics for ethics. We intentionally used an agentic AI system—that uses the OpenAI API for GPT-4.1 (so that we could control temperature), GPT-5 (for structured output), and the Sora 2 app (the API was restricted)—to make the videos to generate content since a lot of online disinformation is distributed automatically by AI systems.
